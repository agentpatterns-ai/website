# GitHub Models in Actions

> Insert AI judgment into GitHub Actions workflows using GitHub Models — no external API keys, version-controlled prompts, and deterministic branching on probabilistic outputs.

## Architecture

GitHub Models exposes 40+ AI models (OpenAI, Mistral, xAI, and others) via a single inference endpoint. Access from Actions requires only `permissions: models: read` and authenticates with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` — no external API key management ([GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/automate-your-project-with-github-models-in-actions/)) [unverified].

Three integration methods are available:

| Method | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `actions/ai-inference@v1` | Inline or file-based prompts in workflow steps |
| `gh models run` CLI | Piping content through models in shell steps |
| `.prompt.yml` files | Versioned, templated prompts with variable substitution |

Models are swappable via a single parameter (e.g., `model: openai/gpt-4.1`, `model: xai/grok-3-mini`), decoupling workflow logic from model choice ([GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/automate-your-project-with-github-models-in-actions/)).

## Prompt File Format

`.prompt.yml` files version-control AI prompts alongside code. The format supports multi-message conversations, template variables with `{{variable}}` syntax, JSON schema response formatting, and per-prompt parameter overrides (`temperature`, `topP`, `maxCompletionTokens`) ([`actions/ai-inference` README](https://github.com/actions/ai-inference)):

```yaml
name: bug-triage
description: Assess whether an issue is a valid bug report
model: openai/gpt-4.1
messages:
  - role: system
    content: >
      Evaluate the issue. Return "pass" if it contains
      reproduction steps and expected behavior. Otherwise
      return a one-line explanation.
  - role: user
    content: "{{issue_body}}"
```

The `response-file` output handles large responses that exceed Actions output size limits ([`actions/ai-inference` README](https://github.com/actions/ai-inference)).

## Deterministic Branching on AI Output

The core pattern: constrain model output to fixed return values, then branch deterministically. Instruct the model to return a known string (e.g., `"pass"`) when criteria are met, enabling standard workflow conditionals ([GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/automate-your-project-with-github-models-in-actions/)):

```yaml
- id: analyze-issue
  uses: actions/ai-inference@v1
  with:
    model: openai/gpt-4.1
    prompt-file: .github/prompts/bug-triage.prompt.yml

- if: steps.analyze-issue.outputs.response != 'pass'
  uses: actions/github-script@v7
  with:
    script: |
      await github.rest.issues.addLabels({
        ...context.repo,
        issue_number: context.issue.number,
        labels: ['needs-info']
      })
```

This turns probabilistic AI output into reliable workflow logic — the same conditional mechanics that drive any Actions workflow.

## Pre-Built Actions

Two production-ready Actions implement common patterns using GitHub Models:

**AI Assessment Comment Labeler** ([`github/ai-assessment-comment-labeler`](https://github.com/github/ai-assessment-comment-labeler)) — runs multiple prompts in parallel against issues, applies structured labels (`ai:<prompt-stem>:<assessment>`), and supports comment suppression ([GitHub Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-09-05-github-actions-ai-labeler-and-moderator-with-the-github-models-inference-api/)).

**AI Moderator** ([`github/ai-moderator`](https://github.com/github/ai-moderator)) — detects spam, link spam, and AI-generated content on issues and comments. Auto-labels flagged content and can minimize it. Supports custom prompt overrides ([GitHub Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-09-05-github-actions-ai-labeler-and-moderator-with-the-github-models-inference-api/)).

Both use the same `models: read` permission pattern with no separate API key management.

## MCP Integration

The `actions/ai-inference` action supports GitHub MCP for read-only access to repos, issues, PRs, users, actions, and code security toolsets. MCP requires a PAT or GitHub App token — the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` is insufficient for MCP. Toolsets are selectable: `github-mcp-toolsets: 'repos,issues,pull_requests'` ([`actions/ai-inference` README](https://github.com/actions/ai-inference)).

## Security Considerations

The primary risk is prompt injection via user-controlled content (issue bodies, PR descriptions, comments) passed as model input. Mitigations ([GitHub Docs: Actions Security Hardening](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions)):

- Grant minimum permissions — avoid `issues: write` if only read is needed
- Scope `GITHUB_TOKEN` tightly per job
- Use intermediate environment variables for untrusted input rather than inline shell interpolation
- Sensitive headers are not automatically masked — use `::add-mask::` explicitly to redact secrets from logs

## Key Takeaways

- `models: read` permission plus `GITHUB_TOKEN` provides zero-configuration AI access in any GitHub Actions workflow
- `.prompt.yml` files version-control prompts with template variables, enabling prompt-as-code practices
- Constrain model output to fixed strings to create deterministic branch points in CI/CD pipelines
- Pre-built labeler and moderator Actions demonstrate the pattern of AI judgment embedded in repository automation
- Treat all user-controlled content as untrusted input when passing to models — apply the same injection defenses used for shell scripts

## Example

A complete workflow that triages new issues using GitHub Models — the prompt file classifies each issue, and the workflow applies labels based on the model's response:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/issue-triage.yml
name: AI Issue Triage
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]

permissions:
  models: read
  issues: write

jobs:
  triage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - id: classify
        uses: actions/ai-inference@v1
        with:
          model: openai/gpt-4.1
          prompt-file: .github/prompts/issue-classifier.prompt.yml
          prompt-file-variables: |
            issue_title=${{ github.event.issue.title }}
            issue_body=${{ github.event.issue.body }}

      - if: steps.classify.outputs.response == 'bug'
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            await github.rest.issues.addLabels({
              ...context.repo,
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              labels: ['bug', 'needs-triage']
            })

      - if: steps.classify.outputs.response == 'feature'
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            await github.rest.issues.addLabels({
              ...context.repo,
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              labels: ['enhancement']
            })
```

```yaml
# .github/prompts/issue-classifier.prompt.yml
name: issue-classifier
description: Classify an issue as bug, feature, or question
model: openai/gpt-4.1
modelParameters:
  temperature: 0
messages:
  - role: system
    content: >
      Classify the GitHub issue. Return exactly one word:
      "bug", "feature", or "question". No other output.
  - role: user
    content: |
      Title: {{issue_title}}
      Body: {{issue_body}}
```

The workflow uses `temperature: 0` and single-word constrained output to maximize determinism. The `models: read` permission grants access to GitHub Models via the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`, requiring no additional secrets.
